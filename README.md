# PyStager
This version of the PyStager is frozen, and no further development will be carried out here. 
Development of the PyStager is continuing in [Earth System Data Exploration](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ias/jsc/about-us/structure/research-groups/esde) in [Jülich Super Computing Centre](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ias/jsc) that is available at: https://gitlab.jsc.fz-juelich.de/esde/workflows/pystager


The code is designed nativly as a wrapper for [mpi4py](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to destribute the work accross mutiple workers. It is developed and deployed on [Jülich Super Computing centre](https://www.fz-juelich.de/de/ias/jsc) infrastructure including [JUWELS cluster and JUWELS booster](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/ias/jsc/systems/supercomputers/juwels).
